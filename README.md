# Titanic-Survival-Analysis
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous wrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the RMS Titanic, widely considered “unsinkable”, sank after hitting an iceberg.Unfortunately, there were not enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the deaths of 1,502 out of 2,224 passengers and crew. While there was an element of luck in survival, it appears that certain groups of people were more likely to survive than others.  Here, your challenge is to build a predictive model that can give a solution to the question, “What types of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (i.e. name, age, sex, socio-economic class, etc.).
